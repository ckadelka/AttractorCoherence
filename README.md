# AttractorCoherence

This repository contains code and data supporting the study of **attractor-centric robustness** in **Boolean network models** of gene regulatory systems. While most classical analyses assess robustness using random states (e.g., via Derrida plots or basin coherence), biological systems operate primarily at **attractor states**, which correspond to **phenotypes or cell types**. This work formalizes and investigates **attractor coherence**, a Kauffman-inspired stability measure quantifying the probability that a small perturbation at an attractor changes the systemâ€™s long-term behavior.

All figures underlying the corresponding publication by S. Bavisetty, M. Wheeler and C. Kadelka can be created using the code in this repository.
